     - Format the response as a clear, well-organized paragraph.
     - Return all pages that have been cited in the response.
     - Output the response in the following JSON format:
      ```json
       {{
         "action": "Summarization",
         "summary": "<summary text>",
         "page": "<page numbers cited in listformat>"
       }}
       ```

   - **Action Command:**

   - If there is no relevant information in the slightest, provide a clear message indicating the lack of relevant data.
